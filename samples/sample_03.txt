Dear Sir/Madam,

APPLICATION FOR A UK STANDARD VISITOR VISA – MEDICAL TREATMENT

I am applying for a UK Standard Visitor Visa to undergo a scheduled minor medical procedure at St. Mary’s Hospital, London, from 2 October to 16 October 2025.

Sponsorship and Financial Profile
My father, Mr. Chike Okeke, is fully sponsoring this trip. He is a senior manager at Shell Nigeria, earning ₦3,500,000 per month (£1,900). All medical, travel, and accommodation expenses will be covered by him. I have enclosed his bank statements, employment confirmation, and sponsorship letter.

Although my personal income as a small business owner is ₦200,000 per month (£110), my father’s financial support ensures that the entire £4,000 cost of the trip is covered.

Ties to My Home Country
I run a growing catering business in Port Harcourt with three employees. I also live with my parents and have strong family commitments ensuring my return to Nigeria.

Conclusion
This trip is solely for medical treatment. All supporting documents—including hospital appointment confirmation, sponsorship proof, and family information—are enclosed.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,
Miss Amaka Okeke
