Sir/Madam,

APPLICATION FOR A UK STANDARD VISITOR VISA – BUSINESS PURPOSES (REAPPLICATION)

I am reapplying for a UK Standard Visitor Visa to attend the Global Pharmacy Innovation Conference in London from 5 November to 9 November 2025. My previous application, submitted on 10 May 2025, was refused on the following grounds:

- Insufficient evidence of personal income.
- Unclear explanation of recent bank deposits.

Clarifications and Additional Evidence
I am the Managing Director of EzePharm Ltd., earning a monthly salary of ₦900,000 (£490). I have attached my payslips and corporate tax receipts to demonstrate stable income.

The deposits in my account reflect payments from three regular pharmaceutical clients. I have enclosed their invoices and payment confirmations to verify these transactions.

Personal and Financial Profile
My monthly expenses average ₦300,000 (£165), leaving a disposable income of ₦600,000 (£325). My current bank balance is ₦4,200,000 (£2,300), which adequately covers my estimated £1,800 trip cost.

Ties to My Home Country
I am married with two children in school in Enugu. My company employs five full-time staff whose operations I personally supervise.

Conclusion
This trip is strictly for attending a professional conference relevant to my business. I have provided complete supporting documentation, including proof of income, business ownership, and clarified bank records.

Thank you for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,
Mrs. Ngozi Eze
