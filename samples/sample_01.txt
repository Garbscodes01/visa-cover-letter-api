Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to apply for a UK Standard Visitor Visa to enable me to spend a short holiday in London from 10 October to 20 October 2025.

Personal and Financial Profile
I am a 34-year-old Nigerian citizen employed as a Senior Software Engineer with Zenith Systems Ltd., earning ₦1,200,000 per month (approximately £650). My monthly expenses average ₦400,000 (£220), leaving a disposable income of ₦800,000 (£430). My current account balance is ₦5,600,000 (£3,000), which comfortably covers my estimated trip cost of £2,000.

Ties to My Home Country
I am married with one daughter who attends school in Lagos. I hold a permanent position at Zenith Systems Ltd., where I have worked for six years. I also own a property in Lagos valued at ₦45,000,000 (£24,000). These commitments strongly ensure my return after my trip.

Conclusion
This trip is purely for tourism. All supporting documents—including bank statements, employment confirmation, marriage certificate, and property documents—are enclosed.

Thank you for considering my application. I respectfully request a favorable decision.

Yours faithfully,
Mr. Olumide Johnson
