"My previous application, submitted on [date], was refused because [state reasons briefly]. I have addressed each point in this application:

- [Reason 1 → Rebuttal]
- [Reason 2 → Rebuttal]

I have also attached additional evidence, including [bank statements/employment letters/invoices], to clarify any previous gaps."

When handling a reapplication after refusal:
- Begin with acknowledgment of previous refusal.
- Briefly state the refusal reason.
- Show how new evidence/documents address it.
- Do not argue emotionally — keep factual and polite.
- Continue with the standard structure after rebuttal.
